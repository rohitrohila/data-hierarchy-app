Here I have create two folder, one for server and one for the UI.
In both you have to first run "npm i" to install all the required dependencies.


Ui is implemented in the VueJS technology and for creating server we are using NodeJS.

When first load all the data come from the server and showing in the UI.
While selecting any one show there all details in the left panel of the ui.
